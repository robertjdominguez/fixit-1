# Welcome to Altacorp

Welcome to Altacorp! We're a clandestine organization striving to make the world a better place. For the next few weeks, you'll be proving you know your stuff. If you can keep up, you'll be hired on as a junior developer for the remainder of the year. To start, here's your first challenge.

## Directions

With another trainee, fix the styling of this page. Your instructor has an end-product on the screen and is available to help you. However, you've already been taught _everything_ you need to know to fix the styling of the page. To help you, there's a checklist below. For complete credit - and to move onto the next challenge at Altacorp - you must _must_ fix the styles AND provide a comment explaining your work.

The HTML is complete except for a little bit of copy you'll need to write for the different projects our company is working on. Almost all of your work will be done in the file named `main.css`.

## Tasks

[] Check these tasks off by placing an `x` in between the brackets!

[] Create a `heading` class in `main.css` and style it to match the end-product

[] Style all `<h1>` elements to be `60px` in size

[] Create a class called `project-card` and style it to match the end-product

[] Create a `proj-title` class with a font-size of `40px`

[] Create a `card-text` class with a font-size of `25px`

[] Style images to stay within their parents if the screen is resized
